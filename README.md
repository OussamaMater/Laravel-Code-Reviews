# Laravel Code Reviews

Laravel has tons of courses and resources where beginners can get started. The only thing I feel lacking in the community is getting your code reviewed by more seasoned Laravel developers. That's why this repository exists.

## How it Works

To submit your code for review:

1. Create a new issue in this repository.
2. Use the issue template provided to submit your code details.
3. Your submission will be added to the review queue.
4. Check the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/OussamaMater/projects/3) to see the current review status.

All submitted repositories **must be public**.

## Review Process

1. Codes are reviewed in the order they are received, with some exceptions. If the code is labeled **junior** or **student**, it will be prioritized.
2. The current PR being reviewed is marked "In Progress" on the Project Board. There will be 1 at a time.
3. Once a review is completed, the issue will be closed, and you can then check the review.
